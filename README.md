# Calculator
## Create a very basic, 4 function calculator within a console application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inside the Program.cs file of your console application you should have 4 external methods plus the ```Main``` method:
+ Add()
+ Sub
+ Multiply
+ Divide

Each of these methods should take in 2 parameters, and return the solution of those 2 numbers. (i.e if you are adding 2 numbers then your return would be the sum of the 2 numbers added together. )

Output to the console the answer to the proposed math problem. You may assume valid input.

### Example Output
```
First number: 1
Operation: +
Second number: 2
Result: 3
```
